# Formatting

- Small files are typically easier to understand than large ones
- Files should read like a newspaper, The higher level stuff (ie. title of the article) should be towards the top, and the details of the article towards the bottom
- Blank lines should serperate related blocks of code
- Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other. The further away from each other the less related they are
- Variables typically should be declared as close to their usage as possible
- Instance methods should be declared at the top of the class (in a well design class the variable should be used by most instance methods)
- If one function calls another, they should be vertically close,
  and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible
- Group blocks of code that have a strong affinity towards each other. (IE. a function that calls another function, a function that calls a variable)
- 80-120 character horizontal limit
