# Comments

- Minimize comments as much as possible, the code should be written to self document

### Good Comments

- Legal
- Informative
- Explanation of Intent
- Clarification
  - should be used very carefully
- Warning of Consequence
- TODO's
- Aplification of something that doesnt seem important

### Good Comments

- Mumbling (meaningful to the author but not the reader)
  - IF you need to search through other modules to understand the comment, its a bad comment
- Redundancy (if the code is self commenting, dont muddy the waters)
- Misleading comments
- Mandated comments
- Journal comments
- Position markers
- Comments after closing braces
- Attributions (version control handles this)
- Commented out code
- Too much information
- Function Headers
