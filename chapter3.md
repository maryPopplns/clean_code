# Functions

- Functions should be as small as possible
- Limit indentation to 2 or 3. When block statements start to become too nested create a method to abstract it.
- Each method should just do 1 thing.
- Have one level of abstraction per function. [ .toUpperCase() - small abstraction / .createHtmlPage() - large abstraction ]
- Functions should be readable like a book. From the top down
- Limit the amount of arguments functions can take. The fewer the better.
- Functions should answer something or do something. NOT BOTH.
- Favor returning excepetions rather than error codes.
- Keep code DRY(dont repeat yourself)
- Iteration is key to creating proper classes, first attempts are rarely ideal
